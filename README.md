# Generative AI Application Development with Docker and Hugging Face

## Overview

This project showcases the development of Generative AI applications using Docker and Hugging Face. The goal is to create containerized applications that utilize state-of-the-art transformer models for various generative tasks, such as text generation, image synthesis, and style transfer.

## Features

- **Containerized Applications**: Built using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
- **Hugging Face Integration**: Leveraged the Hugging Face Transformers library for advanced AI model functionalities.
- **User Interface**: Developed interactive user interfaces for seamless interaction with generative models.
- **Robust Pipeline**: Implemented a robust deployment pipeline for reliable application performance.
- **Best Practices**: Emphasized modular code architecture, version control, and automated testing.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dubeyRock/Generative-AI-Apps.git
   cd Generative-AI-Apps

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dubeyRock/Generative-AI-Apps.git
   cd Generative-AI-Apps
Build the Docker image:

bash

docker build -t generative-ai-app .
Run the Docker container:

bash

docker run -p 5000:5000 generative-ai-app

Access the application: Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000.

##Usage

**Text Generation**: Enter a prompt to generate text using the selected model.

**Image Synthesis**: Upload an image to generate variations or apply style transfer.

**Interactive Features**: Utilize the user interface to explore different functionalities and models.

##Technologies Used

Python

Docker

Hugging Face Transformers
