# Generative AI Application Development with Docker and Hugging Face

## Overview

This project showcases the development of Generative AI applications using Docker and Hugging Face. The goal is to create containerized applications that utilize state-of-the-art transformer models for various generative tasks, such as text generation, image synthesis, and style transfer.

## Features

- **Containerized Applications**: Built using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
- **Hugging Face Integration**: Leveraged the Hugging Face Transformers library for advanced AI model functionalities.
- **User Interface**: Developed interactive user interfaces for seamless interaction with generative models.
- **Robust Pipeline**: Implemented a robust deployment pipeline for reliable application performance.
- **Best Practices**: Emphasized modular code architecture, version control, and automated testing.
